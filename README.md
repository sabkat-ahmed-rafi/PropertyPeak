## About

Our residential real estate website is dedicated to providing users with a seamless experience in finding their ideal homes. Whether it's a cozy apartment, a suburban house, or a luxurious villa, our platform aims to simplify the process of searching, browsing, and selecting properties.

## Libraries Used

To enhance the user experience and add interactive elements to our website, we've utilized the following libraries:

1. **AOS Package**: AOS is a small library that enables you to animate elements as you scroll down, providing a visually appealing way to present content and create engaging user experiences.
   
2. **Animate.css**: Animate.css is a popular library that provides a collection of pre-made CSS animations. It allows us to easily add animations to various elements on our website, making them more lively and engaging.
   
3. **Swiper Slider**: Swiper is a powerful and flexible slider library that enables touch-friendly, responsive, and customizable sliders. We've integrated Swiper to showcase property images and provide an intuitive way for users to navigate through listings.
